Caesar Cipher

This is a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The user can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption or decryption.

## How the Caesar Cipher Works
The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, `A` becomes `D`, `B` becomes `E`, and so on.

## Features
- Encrypts messages using a shift value.
- Decrypts messages using the same shift value in reverse.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Leaves non-alphabetical characters (spaces, punctuation) unchanged.

Example Usage
Enter your message: Hello World
Enter the shift value (number): 3
